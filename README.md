# spaghetti-hud

Today I wanna release my personal HUD of Spaghetti Western for RedM with the hunger, thirst and temperature. 
In the client/server side of the script you can find an "alpha" build of a Stress System, you can edit it by yourself to make it works.  
If you want to use my metabolism, just check for srp:drink and srp:eat, otherwise just adapt the hud with your personal metabolism in the client side  

I hope you enjoy it, Malik
